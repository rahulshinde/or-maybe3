							Perhaps one of the more interesting question posing graphic designers today is what to do in rationalizing their position within whatever capitalist superstructure we currently occupy. At its most abstract, I believe it is fair to simplify the graphic designer as one who aesthetically validates consumer models, while only engaging on the periphery. There is no ‘content’ so to speak, only a veneer that is being applied. While there is an inherent passivity to this role, perhaps what is most interesting is the possibility that the designer ceases to be a consumer in instances where they happen to be shaping the visual side of the consumer experience. This action gives graphic designers a certain power of observation (not to be confused with real power, ‘power’, which only exists if there is a claim to power that occurs prior to production. Obvious examples, that might offend many, include but are not limited to: all white designers regardless of gender, but I only mention this to make myself feel better). What I mean by this may be deceptively simple, or / maybe, a gross oversimplification. But I do believe consumer models give us access to a relationship we take so much precaution in hiding. The system of production as it interfaces with the mask of the consumer. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Is it fair to say that, before the interference of a graphic designers (ad [digital] agencies) hand on a product, products serve no cultural value, and have to be understood based on there engineered function e.g. a coat must be able to keep you warm? A designer is the active participant in the construction of the consumers mask. The arbiter of neo-liberal identity and micro-individual world-views by disguising the action of attempting to frame simple services, (that people have every right to provide for themselves), as being intrinsic to the shaping of culture outside the buyers sphere of influence?
							<br>
							<br>
							Models of american tourism as the consume an individuals pursuit of absolution. What do you feel sorry for? Something that apologies don’t have the ability to fix ?, and in an act of solidarity, is the feeling of being ‘right’ something you can get off on, physically I mean? Like, could this make you cum ?, I might have tried a couple times (successfully).

							Graphic design, as it is currently practiced, operates under the false notion of optimization which has been historically informed by systems of capitalism which correlate longevity with profit. Systems requiring some form of commercial sustainability bring with them an inherent necessity to operate within this constraint regardless of their intent. I find it hard to articulate myself clearly on this issue, given that:
							<br>
							<br>
								1. I’m (was at the time of writing) still operating from within the safety of academia
								<br>
								2. This notion is regularly discounted as “idealism”
							<br>
							<br>
							I don’t mean to bring up economics as if it is the focus of my practice, only to provide context, given the ease through which it is possible to abstract a rudimentary understanding of systems theory, for the purposes of where my work may be potentially heading.
							<br>
							<br>
							Expressions of Doubt operates as a dichotomy, through which I can access both a certain level of self-hate or / maybe masochism, as it relates to methods of working, as well as a simplified thesis containing an allusion to the projects end goal: *Potentially* to confront a medium that I have chosen to dedicate a portion of my life in the service of, given its failures which have been predetermined since its conception.

							<br>
							<br>

							For an experience to be memorable there needs to be a change over time: the definition of <span class="italic">plot</span>. However before plot can run its course, it must be given a physical context (place and time): the definition of <span class="italic">setting</span>. Perhaps the <span class="italic">characters</span> which perform <span class="italic">actions</span>, will be developed through external means, i.e. separated physically from plot. Actions only exist in service of plot. Plot provides a necessity to justify the users completion of a “story.”

							<br>
							<br>

							A more active participant poses an interesting problem especially when they are not familiar with the medium(s) that they are presented with (in this case a multi-media installation).

							An example of the opposite: 
							<br>
							Stories presented in a traditional book format give readers an expectation that the object they are interfacing w/ has a definite beginning, middle, and end (referring to the object, not necessarily the story it contains). It also inherently suggests that it should be read in a particular order given how english (or any other language) functions (you are reading this left to right).

							<br>
							<br>

							<span class="italic">A break from standardized symbolic systems, or, Pretending that the visual arts and writing are the exact same thing (b, c):</span>

							<br>
							<br>

							I have never figured out how to <span class="italic">read</span> a painting, especially when dealing w/ abstraction. after spending a little more time in museums/galleries after coming to college I started to develop the habit of trying to see how far back into the piece I could go. To me the upper, lower, and peripheral boundaries were inherently defined by the edge of the canvas, so the only thing left to establish was it’s implied depth. The “surface” on which the paint sits is fairly easy to understand given its physicality. After establishing a solid working space which I can explore virtually (through a reconstruction in my mind, because, I do think when we are exploring artificial spaces, it is not a relationship with the physical piece that we are entering, but instead the potential for physical interaction that we are forced to construct and experience in relation to time, i.e. a painting is static, we are not.) the question remains, for “for what purpose,” or maybe, what is the plot.

							<br>
							<br>

							<span class="italic">“for what purpose”:</span>

							<br>
							<br>

							When talking about my work I’d like to say that I have always been a painter. I like that this sounds as ridiculous as it makes me feel:
							<br>
							It makes me feel similar to when my friends want to take a picture with me, and I would like to have documentation of my life, specifically in this particular period of time, but I am also slightly embarrassed because I want to look good/don’t want to look like I’m trying to hard, and also simultaneously think that it is ridiculous that I should feel this way. As a result a good portion of my photos have me smiling while moving my face away from the camera, but my shoulders still square to the frame, because secretly I feel as if this is where I belong, but perhaps want someone to tell me its ok that I’m there.
							
							<br>
							<br>

							Content for me is very difficult. I would like to believe in ideals such as form follows function. Or more specific to this discussion, form in the service of content. Which, given this discussion, might be better written as form in the service of _______TBD_______ . This absence, or deferral, in my mind, has a one to one relationship to my lack of experience, i.e. I have been taught everything I know as opposed to, I have learned everything I know. I only make such a harsh distinction between the two because of the pressure/urgency that I feel to answer this question. I feel like investing myself into a lived experience will solve all my problems i.e my exit from academia, will immediately give me some type of global perspective to rationalize my work through, or maybe, the grass is always greener on the other side, meaning, I  can differ any/all responsibility i have to be socially conscious within my work until after I start working, and then find another excuse when I get there.

							I saw her black leather shoes next to your bed and while you were asleep, with a rush of jealousy I leaked to your bookcase and stroked the spines of your twelve books. 
							<br>

							You woke up shortly after and asked what I was doing there, midday in ashram while everyone decompressed I was wide awake. 
							<br>
							<br>
							I saw the video you made 
							of a blue butterfly at dusk and cats embracing each other and your mother's feet. It was beautiful. 
							<br>
							<br>
							The other day while you were climbing to the stacked stones in the ancient sanctuary, I looked at you with great gratitude, you were present just like the hanging bones behind you, you were there.
							Arabella brought me three lucid crystals that she found,  "I will make a necklace and a pair of earrings." 
							<br>
							<br>
							Soon the rhythm of the drums started and everyone gathered in a circle to dance, accumulating mud with each move. I wanted to show you how well I could bend my limbs from my center of gravity but you were not there. 
							<br>
							I knew then that solitude was what you seek, but then why was Tristesse's shoes placed gently next to you, was she there with you?  
							As I write now you're back to sleep, groundbreaking young man, hide your glimmering eyes well for they may see what you behold and try to capture it in nets.

							<br>
							3.	One interview/discussion will be conducted. We will record the first hour: any discussion occurring after the hour will be left undocumented.

							4.	First week is ideally a means for setting up a working practice i.e. choosing mediums/tools, picking a faculty advisor to consult for any technical or conceptual questions.
							<br>
							5.	The following five days would used for assembling all of the content generated and beginning to analyze/respond to it. At this point we would start thinking about how it should be digitally documented.
							<br>
							6.	One week of isolation, this is both to allow for contemplation and to catchup on any work that doesn’t get finished during the previous to weeks/give me some buffer room.

							<br>
							From wikipedia: A portrait is a <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_painting">painting</a> or other artistic representation of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the <span class="line-through">likeness</span>, <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type">personality,</a> and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot, but a composed image of a person in a still position. A portrait often shows <span class="line-through">a person looking directly at the painter or photographer</span>, in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer,
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="italic">or / maybe</span> a portrait is a digital response to a person in which their face ( google definition: the surface of a thing [in this case a collaborators practice], especially one that is presented to the viewer with a particular function in mind). The intent is to display "personality". A portrait in this scenario, is an exercise in personal expulsion as opposed to representation, it becomes a clarification of expectation.

							<br>
							<span class="italic">EXTERNAL:</span>
							<br>
							But, in my mind I couldn’t seem to be able to figure out where I was heading, and perhaps my goal was to impose this burden, externally, onto you.

							Production in certain volumes is meant to be a safety net for an absent participant.

							Maximalism has always been an excuse.
